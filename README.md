# Raiders Handbook

A lightweight search tool designed for quick reference during or after a raid. This project provides a simple, parsable dataset inspired by [u/pRoDeeD](https://www.reddit.com/user/pRoDeeD/) [Master Cheat Sheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qejwdq/oc_arc_raiders_master_cheat_sheet_v32_16x9_pdf/).
